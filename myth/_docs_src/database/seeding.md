# Database Seeds

Seeds allow you to populate your database with test data using simple Seed classes. All seeds are stored in `application/database/seeds`. They can be named however you want to name them, but will typically follow a convention, like `UserDataSeeder`, `LocationSeeder` or `ClientSeeder`. By default, a `TestSeeder` is provided for you to jump in and extend. From this class you can use the `call()` method to run other seeders, controlling the seed order and staying organized. You also have access to the `$ci` superglobal, and the `$db` and `$dbforge` objects.

## Creating a Seeder
A seeder should extend the `Seeder` class and contain the `run()` method. Everything else is pretty flexible. You could:

- use the `$db` object and pull in an SQL dump and run it through the system
- read CSV files and populate the database that way.
- fill in a table using random data generated using [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker)
- and more...

```php
class TestSeeder extends Seeder {

	public function run()
	{
		$this->call('UserSeeder');
	}
}

class UserSeeder extends Seeder {

	public function run()
	{
		$this->db->truncate('users');
		
		$this->db->insert('users', array('username'=>'DarthV') );
	}
}
```

## Running the Seeders
Seeders must be run from the command line, using the database tools, and passing the name of the seed class as the last argument.
